## Overview
Stock data analysis involves evaluating financial data to gain insights into market trends, stock performance, and trading patterns. This document describes a sample dataset and key metrics that can be derived from stock trading data.

## Dataset Description
The dataset consists of 100 records of daily stock trading data for 10 different companies. Each record includes the following fields:
- **Stock Symbol**: The ticker symbol representing the company (e.g., AAPL, MSFT).
- **Date**: The trading date.
- **Opening Price**: The stock price at the start of the trading session.
- **Closing Price**: The stock price at the end of the trading session.
- **Volume**: The number of shares traded during the day.

### Derived Metrics
Additional metrics are calculated for analytical purposes:
1. **Daily Change**: The absolute difference between the Closing Price and the Opening Price.
   - Formula: `Daily Change = Closing Price - Opening Price`
2. **Percentage Change (%)**: The daily price movement as a percentage of the Opening Price.
   - Formula: `Percentage Change (%) = (Daily Change / Opening Price) * 100`
3. **High Volume Flag**: A boolean flag indicating whether the trading volume exceeded 500,000 shares.

### Example Data
| Stock Symbol | Date       | Opening Price | Closing Price | Volume   | Daily Change | Percentage Change (%) | High Volume |
|--------------|------------|---------------|---------------|----------|--------------|------------------------|-------------|
